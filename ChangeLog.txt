ChangeLog

Linuxgurugamer's Fork

Beta-1	Initial beta for 1.2.1

Beta-2	Initial public beta 

Beta-3	Bug fixes
		Stuts are now hiding
		Stock fairings now work properly (ie:  offset & hide)
		Lights of the VAB are an unavoidable side effect of the way this works.  I suggest you try downloading LightsOut, and turn off the VAB lights when you don't want the reflections
		Shadows are either on or off.  I'll change it to be a toggle later
		Ground shadow again a side effect of the way the mod works

0.0.6	First non-beta release
		Fixed null ref when going into flight
		Added support for stock fairings exploding and opacity (some dirty Reflection code)
		Added .version file
		Added version info into Assembly info
		Converted numeric inputs into sliders on config screens
		Converted shaders into bundle files
		Added bundle files for all environments (Window, Windows OpenGL, OSX and Linux)
		Removed engine fairing explode option
